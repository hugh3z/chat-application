I aimed to create a portfolio website to showcase what I have learned in web development. The website had to feature a chat application. I decided to utilize this as a communication method with myself. 

The color theme remains consistent throughout the website. The colors were chosen due to their accessibility. The colors have a contrast between them to make them stand out from each other, these colors also work well when in dark mode. The fonts were also chosen with accessibility in mind. The fonts are simple but bold. 

On developing the website I started with the Contact page. This page has my email address for people to ask further questions about my work. It also is the page that includes the chat application. This allows users of the website to be able to ask questions more easily and gain a response quicker. This can be useful for getting involved in projects quickly. The contact page also has a frequently asked questions section that was implemented using Javascript buttons, these keep the webpage clean and stop an overwhelming amount of emails or messages. This webpage also includes a brief mention of working hours.
