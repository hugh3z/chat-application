        <h1>About Page</h1>
        <h2> Hello! My name is Ellen Hughes and I am an 18 year old computer science student at the University of Aberdeen.
              I have made this website to showcase my skills within web development. During my time at school I have been lucky enough to 
              have many opportunities. This has allowed me to have many hobbies and gain lots of unique skills. </h2>

        <h4> Volunteering </h4>
        <p> I have volunteered with various organisations throughout my life time. The one that has had the biggest impact on my life is SHIP.
          This stands for Support, Help and Integration in Perthshire. It is a charity in my home town for young people with additional support needs
          I volunteered for 2 years however I now have a part time job there. This charity has helped me to improve alot of skills. My communication skills 
          are very strong as I have had the chance to interact with both parents and children using different communication methods.
          This relates to my work in web development as I have had first hand experience in the accesibility of technology. I aim to make all my websites
          have suitable colour schemes and easy navigation. Click on the image below to find out more or get involved!

        <h4> Within School</h4>
        <p> In school I took part in a wide variety of the roles available to me. In my final year at school I was part of the head team.
          This role required me to have good organisational skills. I had a large involvement in organising school events such as Winterball. 
          This skill is transferable into my work in web development as it makes for good time management within my websites. This is because
          due to organisation skills before every project I create a time plan and a design plan. This means every project meets its deadline
          while still being high quality.
        </p>
        

        <h4> Dance </h4>
        <p> Dance is one of my current hobbies. I attend classes weekly. I love the social aspect of dance and all the group work it comes with.
          Creating dances and learning to trust each other are valuable group work skills that I thank dance for. The same love for group work
          is still with me in my web development career. I really enjoy getting to be creative with a group and seeing the end result in the form of a website!
          It means I get to be constantly learning new styles and techniques from everyone around me. Currently I dance with Aberdeen Dance society which you can find out more about below. </p>

        <h4>School</h4>
        <p>I studied the subject of computer science for all 6 years at highschool. Throughout this time I've continued to expand my website development skills,
          I have made a range of websites at different levels. In the later years of school I leared Javascript and PHP these improved my web skills significantly. 
          PHP has allowed me to create dynamic and interactive websites. For my final project in advanced higher I used PHP to connect a basic snake game to a database of users.
          Javascript has alos been a langauge that has helped me with the design of websites greatly. Upon learning Javascript in Higher computer science my wesbites are more appealing.
          I love the use of Javascript buttons to make information hide and appear, this keeps my websites looking clean while still having all the necessary information. </p>

        <h4>University</h4>
        <p>During my first year an university I revisted HTML5 and Javascript which was a great refresher and expanded what I already know. 
          On top of this I learned Bootstrap. This has helped with the design of my websites. It has helped me significantly in making sure my
          websites are repsonsive on all device types. Bootstrap and Java script have been used throughout this website to ensure it works on multiple devices
          and still has strong and consistent design. I look forward to learning more about web development in University to continue improving my websites.
